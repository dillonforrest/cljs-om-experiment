Creating a publisher dash application for prototyping.  Desired business objectives are:
- filtering
- sorting
- pagination

So far, minimal prototype is complete.  Would still like to add:
- routing
- creating & editing publishers (just the views, not actual creation and editing)
- More robust filter-sort
- routing
- creating & editing publishers views
- advanced compile optimizations
- tests? o__O
