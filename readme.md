Creating a publisher dash application for prototyping.  Desired business objectives include the front-end objectives in joe wilners code test, plus
- routing
- creating & editing publishers (just the views, not actual creation and editing)

So far, minimal prototype is complete.  Would still like to add:
- More robust filter-sort
- routing
- creating & editing publishers views
- advanced compile optimizations
- tests? o__O
